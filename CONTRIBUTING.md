## Why This Matters

Fusion 360 is an amazing CAD/CAM system. It has a user-friendly interface, powerful modeling tools, simulation, and CNC programming features. Unfortunately, the built-in post-processors in the free version (especially for hobbyists and students) are often limited or don't work as expected.

Because of this, many people have to switch to other CAM systems, losing the simplicity and power of Fusion 360. I want to change that.

## Invitation to Contribute

**SmartPost** is a project created to give hobbyists full access to post-processing capabilities in Fusion 360, including:

- Tool changes without restrictions
- Removal of watermarks
- Support for any `.cps` post-processors
- **Rapid moves in toolpaths** (coming soon)

⚠️ I don't hack or patch Fusion. Everything is completely legal and fair — we use undocumented features that Autodesk has hidden for some reason.

## Calling All Python/CNC Developers!

I'm building a tool to help Fusion 360 users stay license-compliant while getting the most from the software. As a solo developer, I could really use your help with:

Key Development Needs:
- Enhancing the `xml.cps` post-processor
- Improving G-code merging logic
- UI/UX refinements
- Better error handling/logging
- Multi-machine support
- Documentation improvements

How to Contribute:

1. Fork & modify the code (MIT licensed - just keep attribution)
2. Submit Pull Requests or share ideas via Issues
3. No strict rules - just keep changes focused

For Non-Coders:
- Report bugs/suggest features
- Help test new versions
- Star & share the project

**Every contribution helps make this tool better for Fusion 360 users!**

## Thank You

Every contribution matters. Even a small change to the [README](README.md) or code advice can impact hundreds of users. Thank you for reading!
